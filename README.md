## Eslint Prettier Husky Lint-staged

[![main](https://github.com/rajjaiswalsaumya/eslint-prettier-husky-lintstaged/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rajjaiswalsaumya/eslint-prettier-husky-lintstaged/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.13. This is a demo
setup with all required plugins support for standard angular app development. The plugins added in this repo are:

- Eslint
  - AirBnB base styleguide
  - Typescript styleguide
- Prettier
- Husky
- Lint Staged

## Current Issues

This project solves the current issues in eslint and provides the compatible binaries that can be run with airbnb base
styleguide. Please note, once angular-eslint supports eslint 8.X, this repository will be updated.

## Angular Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.

## Angular Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also
use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Angular Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Jasmine / Karma unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running Protractor end-to-end tests

Currently, this project does not add any e2e framework as angular has removed direct support for e2e, and now it is
developer choice based. You can add protractor or Cypress based on your choice.

## Further help

Please report if you face any issues.
